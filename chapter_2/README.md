# chapter_2

This folder contains the supplementary materials for chapter 2 of the PhD thesis that is not found within the thesis itself.

As mentioned in the **Data availabilty** section within chapter 2 of the thesis, the codes are available at: [https://github.com/akamolphat/myna_popgen]. This [github repository](https://github.com/akamolphat/myna_popgen) refers to the link used in the published article, and therefore the details in the link refers to the Figures and Tables in the published article. The main differences are as follows:

* The figures and tables in the main text of the published article now have a "2." prefix. For example, Figure 1 in the main text of the published article refers to Figure 2.1 in the thesis. Hence, what is referred to as "Figure 1" in the [github repository](https://github.com/akamolphat/myna_popgen) refers to "Figure 2.1" in the thesis.
* Like the point above, the figures and tables in the supplementary materials of the published article now have a "A" prefix. Hence, what is referred to as "Figure S1" in the [github repository](https://github.com/akamolphat/myna_popgen) refers to "Figure A1" in the thesis.

`TableA1.2.xlsx` corresponds to Table A1.2 mentioned in the Appendix A of the PhD thesis. It corresponds to Table S1.2 in the published version of the chapter (Atsawawaranunt et al., 2023). It corresponds to TableS1.2v2.csv found in the corresponding [dryad repository](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.xsj3tx9m7)
