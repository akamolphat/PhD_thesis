# chapter_2

This folder contains supplementary materials of chapter 2 of the PhD thesis that are not included in the thesis itself.

`TableA1.2.xlsx` corresponds to Table A1.2 mentioned in the Appendix A of the PhD thesis. It corresponds to TableS1.2v2.csv found in the corresponding [dryad repository](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.xsj3tx9m7)

As mentioned in the **Data availabilty** section within chapter 2 of the thesis, the codes are available at: [https://github.com/akamolphat/myna_popgen]. This github repository is the one used for the published article (Atsawawaranunt et al., 2023), and therefore the details in the repository refer to the Figures and Tables in the published article, which differs from the PhD thesis as follows:

* The figures and tables in the main text of the thesis have a "2." prefix to each Figure/Table number. For example, Figure 2.1 in the thesis equates to Figure 1 in the published article and the associated github repository. 
* Similarly, the figures and tables in Appendix A of the thesis have a "A" prefix to each Figure/Table number, instead of the "S" prefix used in the supplementary materials of the published article. For example, Figure A1 in the thesis equates to Figure S1 in the published article and the associated github repository.
