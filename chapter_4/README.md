# chapter_4

This folder contains supplementary materials of chapter 4 of the PhD thesis that are not included in Appendix C of the thesis.

`Supplementary_tables.xlsx` contains Tables C1.2, C2.5, C2.6, and C3.3 from Appendix C.

As mentioned in the **Data availability** section of chapter 4 of the thesis, the codes are available at: https://github.com/akamolphat/myna_selection which is the github repository of the submitted article.
The details in the repository refer to the Figures and Tables in the submitted article, which differs from the PhD thesis as follows:

* The figures and tables in the main text of the thesis have a "4." prefix to each Figure/Table number. For example, Figure 4.1 in the thesis equates to Figure 1 in the submitted article and the associated github repository. 
* Similarly, the figures and tables in Appendix C of the thesis have a "C" prefix to each Figure/Table number, instead of the "S" prefix used in the supplementary materials of the published article. For example, Figure A1 in the thesis equates to Figure S1 in the submitted article and the associated github repository.
